          <p className="aboutme">
        I am a third year Computer Science student studying at Ryerson University. In terms of my studies I am currently interested in the fields of artificial intelligence, data sciences, software development, and computer graphics. My dream job in computer science would be to create or help the development of an indie game, as I love the fresh and unique aspects that are just missing in many mainstream games today. As for myself, I am always eager and excited to learn new things and create new projects that both further my learning and help others. In my spare time you can find me enjoying walks with my dog, practicing martial arts, playing Frisbee, and weightlifting.

                    <p>In the past during high school all I have played around with basic HTML and CSS websites and it was not until University where I have taken a course which specializes in this. During, second year I took a course called CPS530 which was an introductory course to web development. Here is where I learned the basics of different front-end and back-end frameworks and how the whole process worked. Then I saw some of my other friends creating their own web portfolios and thought it wouldâ€™ve been a good idea to make one for myself and taaadaa this is how this site became into existence. Now I work on my web development skills in my spare time, creating web applications here and there and always trying to update my portfolio. Next steps for me in this field is to learn better ways to create a more user friendly UI. </p>

                    <p>I would like to identify as an active individual who enjoys a lot of team sports. Growing up I always played basketball and volleyball with my friends during recess and I still enjoy playing recreationally today. In addition, as a child I was enrolled into Karate classes since I had a love for Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan movies and I immediately fell in love with it. Karate has been a staple in my life since 2007 till now and for personal achievement I have gotten up to the rank of third dan black belt (3rd-degree black belt). Karate has taught me many life skills such as self-confidence, responsibility, perseverance, and many social skills. Today, I still teach part time as it is something that I enjoy doing and it always challenges me to problem solve as I try to organize and instruct large classes of many ages. As for competitive team sports, ultimate frisbee was a sport that I accidently tried out for during high school and really enjoyed. It taught me how valuable communication is in a team dynamic and how to win as a team. </p>

                    <p>Growing up I was always a lean and skinny boy which has always somewhat bothered me. So, one day one of my best friends Patrick introduced me to lifting and going to the gym and that really is what pushed me to try and change my physical appearance. In one summer, I gained 20lbs and slowly integrated going to the gym into my daily routine. I gone from not being able to lift even the bar all the way to hitting 155lbs for bench press, 315 for deadlift, and 225 for squatting. Being able to hit these numbers in such a short period of time really reassured me that I was on the right track and was a huge confidence booster to myself. These numbers are definitely not something to brag about, but it is a start and I am continuing to try to best these numbers every school term.</p>

Some games I am currently playing are: The Binding of Isaac, Slay the Spire, Dead Cells, Dicey Dungeons, Streets of Rouge, and many more! It would be a dream of mine to one day be part of a development team for a project like this.</p>
